# Red 7

A python implementation of the card game Red 7.

## Getting Started
I highly reccomend running this program on a local machine instead of replit, due to replit's console being very slow. This causes a scanning effect, whereas on a local machine everything runs smoothly.

### Prerequisits
- Python 3.9+
